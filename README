Projekt 7 is a 3 column, database based audio player that organizes music in a more usable fashion than a single massive 10,000+ item long list of tracks.  Tracks are grouped by artist and album (sorted by year).  They play through as you would expect them to if they were in the single massive list.  Track queueing, shuffling, and history are implemented and function as expected and can all handle track deletion.

KNOWN ISSUES:
1) The player saves the location in the song that was playing when it was quit previously and will restore playback from that point.  As of now, there appears to be no way to set the "seek slider" to that point in the song without actually playing it when initializing.
2) When loading files, the mime-type filters need work.
3) When hiding the playlist, the window remembers the minimum height required to diplay the playlist and current width of the window instead of shrinking to the minimum width and height possible.
4) When quitting the application from the "Quit" menu option in either the File menu, or the system tray's popup menu, KConfigGroup information is not being written.
  - cleanup() is getting called, but the information is not getting saved.

HELPER SCRIPTS:
render_icons: uses inkscape to render projekt7.svg in the various sizes used by KDE4
make: builds and installs Projekt 7 into ~/bin
build_deb: builds debian source and binary pacakges for your architecture in ./deb

FUTURE PLANS:
1) Make use of the `playcount` field in the database
2) Add a background thread to open and read track length from recently added tracks, stored in the `length` field in the database
3) Create a "database statistics" window
   - number of artists, albums, and tracks
   - total play time of all tracks
   - 'n' to 'n+9' "top" tracks (1 to 10, then 11 to 20, then ... )
4) Display track length and album lenth
   - length right aligned in column
5) Integrate libvisual or newer, more functional equivalent
NOTE: FUTURE PLANS listed in no particular order
